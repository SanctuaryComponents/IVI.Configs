================

If you do not have any proxy, just comment all export lines 
For Git Proxying, you need to install connect-proxy package

- Edit content of Build.Directory.setting to the name you want for the full build environnement
- Edit Used.Layers.db to add/remove/change source location of each layer used in build.
